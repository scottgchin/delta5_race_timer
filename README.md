# Delta 5 Race Timer

### Description:

Multi-node radio frequency race timer for drone racing. This timing system uses the 5.8Ghz video signals being broadcast by FPV racing drones to trigger a lap timer; no additional equipment required on the drone. Each receiver node is tuned to the video frequency that a drone is broadcasting on. Each of the receiver nodes are connected to a raspberry pi, which aggregates the data and also provides a simple user interface for the race director. Up to eight video frequencies can be tracked in a race.
